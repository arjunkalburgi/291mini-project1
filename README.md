# 291mini-project1
code for CMPUT 291 Mini-Project 1

Andrea tasks Oct 20:
1. create staff login interface
2. read over lab powerpoint

Comments:
-   I feel like I'm going too far on the Python
    side of things and not actually interacting
    with the database enough -- like in
    __init__ for staff, I initialize the values
    in the Python class but I don't add a new
    staff member to the table in the database...
-   the second_task function isn't finished, and
    we can move things around if we need to
-   oops, that while loop shouldn't be in print_welcome
    anymore (now erased)
